# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

In order to see your local implementations and to test the website, run the following command:

```
$ npm start
```
or
```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```
or
```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The project is hosted within GitHub pages, you can access the last version of the website here: [https://lbte.github.io/design-patterns/](https://lbte.github.io/design-patterns/)
